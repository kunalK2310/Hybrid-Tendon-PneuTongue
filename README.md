# Hybrid-Tendon-PneuTongue
This project is designed to replicate the human swallowing motion to investigate the phenomenon of backwash. It features a tendon actuation system driven by four servo motors arranged in pairs. One pair manages the base of the tongue, adding and releasing tension in an antagonistic setup to facilitate bending. The other pair controls the tip of the tongue. The structure was fabricated using a BAMBU P1P printer and TPU 95A filament, selected for its flexibility to mimic the natural curvature of the tongue.

Currently under development, this TPU 95A tongue will be coated with EcoFlex 00-30, a soft elastomer. The coating will include cavities that sequentially fill to simulate the wave-like motion of swallowing, effectively pushing the fluid towards the back of the mouth.

The pneumatic control setup depicted utilizes principles from the Soft Robotics Toolkit (https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/control-board). A crucial component in this system is the MOSFET, which is responsible for timing and delivering PWM signals to the solenoid valves. The PWM signal does not control how far the valves open but rather how long they stay open during each cycle. For instance, a duty cycle of 75% means the valve is open for 75% of the cycle and closed for the remaining 25% at a 50Hz frequency. This modulation allows for precise control over the flow rate of air through the valves. Unlike a continuous digital signal, which would keep the valves open full-time without modulation, PWM adjusts the duration of valve opening within each cycle. This approach doesn't directly regulate pressure but influences flow dynamics. While pressure sensors can provide feedback to fine-tune PWM duty cycles for desired pressures, I relied on visual observation to achieve the required deformation in my applications.
